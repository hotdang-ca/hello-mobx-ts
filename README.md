# Hello, MobX + TypeScript!

## Why
I like React, especially [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but I also like a couple of modules that `create-react-app` just hasn't gotten around to including, such as [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) (Unopinionated and simple state management stores) and [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) (Top-notch code inteligence).

So, thanks to the power of [React-Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired), I can have the best of both worlds!

## Getting Started
Clone, `npm install`, and `npm run` just like any other `create-react-app` project. `react-scripts` references have been changed to `react-app-rewired`; the overrides that I'm using and their settings are specified in `config-overrides.js`.
